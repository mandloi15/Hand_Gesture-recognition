Hand Gesture Recognition
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that uses computer vision and machine learning to classify different hand signs. It can be used for controlling applications, creating interactive experiences, or as a foundation for more complex human-computer interaction systems. The system captures video from a webcam, processes the hand movements, and predicts the corresponding gesture.

Features
Real-time Detection: The system processes video streams in real time to provide instant gesture recognition.

Customizable Gestures: You can train the model on new gestures to expand its functionality.

Simple and Efficient: Built with well-known libraries, it's easy to set up and runs efficiently.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

OpenCV: Used for video capture, image processing, and real-time hand tracking.

TensorFlow/Keras: The machine learning framework for building and training the gesture recognition model.

NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and data manipulation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/mandloi15/Hand_Gesture-recognition.git
cd Hand_Gesture-recognition
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the gesture recognition script:

Bash

python main.py
Training a new model:
If you want to train the model with your own gestures, you'll need to collect data first.

Capture data: Run the data collection script to record images of your gestures.

Train the model: Use the training script to build and save a new model.
